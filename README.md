**THIS IS NOT TO BE USED FOR ANY REAL-WORLD APPLICATION**

This is a simple HTTP server that I wrote using the Socket API and POSIX multithreading to accomodate multiple users. The server is absolutely not secure and should, therefore,
not be used in any serious real-world application. This particlar version of this server simply just repeats back the message that the user enters, but can certainly be adapted to run
any sort of program on the input that the user provides. The purpose of this project wasn't really for me to create an program with the user input, but rather a way for me to understand the
socket API and POSIX threading in a real-world project. I will probably try to see if I can make this server a little bit faster or safer but for now I'm happy with the knowledge that I gained
while building it and it certainly turned out to be a fun little project for me to work on during my final week of winter break from university.
